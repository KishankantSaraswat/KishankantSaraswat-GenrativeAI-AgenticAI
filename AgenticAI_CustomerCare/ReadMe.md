# 🧠 AI-Driven Event Notification Workflow using n8n

This project automates the process of reading events from Google Calendar, generating intelligent responses using a Groq Chat Model, and sending structured outputs to a remote API endpoint.

---

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

This n8n workflow performs the following steps:

1. **⏰ Schedule Trigger**  
   Automatically triggers the workflow at defined intervals (e.g., hourly/daily).

2. **📅 Get Many Events (Google Calendar)**  
   Fetches upcoming calendar events using the `getAll` operation from Google Calendar.

3. **🤖 AI Agent (n8n AI Node)**  
   Uses an AI agent to process calendar data and generate a meaningful, structured summary or action item.

4. **🧠 Groq Chat Model**  
   Powers the AI Agent with a large language model to interpret or generate responses based on event data.

5. **📦 Structured Output Parser**  
   Parses the raw output from the LLM into structured format (JSON or other schema), suitable for use in downstream systems.

6. **🌐 HTTP Request**  
   Sends the structured AI response to an external API endpoint:
   ```
   POST https://api.retellai.com/...
   ```

## ⚙️ Dependencies

- [n8n](https://n8n.io/)
- Google Calendar credentials (OAuth2)
- Groq API Key (for Chat Model)
- API access to RetellAI or your desired destination

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Install n8n**  
   You can run it via Docker, CLI, or the hosted version.

2. **Connect Accounts**
   - Google Calendar: Authenticate with OAuth2.
   - Groq Model: Add API credentials under "API Credentials".

3. **Configure the Schedule Trigger**
   - Set your desired time interval (e.g., every day at 8:00 AM).

4. **Customize Prompts (Optional)**
   - Modify the AI Agent prompt to suit your use case (e.g., meeting summaries, notifications, etc.).

5. **Set HTTP Endpoint**
   - Replace the POST URL with your actual endpoint or webhook.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Send daily meeting summaries to your voice AI platform using a custom calendar digest generated by AI.
